# Introduction

My name is Eugene "Gene" Wilfred Gadd. I was born on December 15th, 1931, at
Trinity Lutheran Hospital in Kansas City, Missouri. My dad said that he paid the
doctor that delivered me by building him a brick fireplace.

I was named after my uncle, Gene, who lived in Lebanon, Missouri. My middle name
came from my father, Wilfred, who was also born on December 15th. Sharing a date
of birth with my dad always made me feel special, especially on my birthday.
