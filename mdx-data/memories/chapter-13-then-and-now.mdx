## Chapter 13 - Then and Now

### The Discipline Divide

Discipline in families has changed dramatically since I was raised in the 1930s,
when we were expected to do exactly what we were told. Many children back then
were raised with the concept that "children should be seen and not heard,"
though I don't agree with this approach since children need interaction with
adults to develop properly.

We would be spanked if we didn't follow our parents' orders, and no one was
concerned about what we now call child abuse. I wish there could be a happy
medium between appropriate discipline and being abusive. I believe that a
spanking at the right time can help a child understand the difference between
right and wrong. The old saying "spare the rod and spoil the child" often makes
sense, though I also know that some parents cross the line into abuse, which I
absolutely don't condone.

Today, you hear children not only raising their voices to their parents but
actually telling them to "shut up!" Because of how I was raised, I would never
allow my children to speak to me disrespectfully. Respect was never an issue
with Mike, Cathy, Patty, or Rebecca, but it has been confusing for Jeff, Kevin,
and Brett because they've heard their friends talk back to their parents and
wonder why our family operates differently.

### Changes in Standard of Living

Being raised in the 1930s has helped me appreciate and enjoy all the
technological advances of the last 50 to 60 years. My parents had one radio, one
telephone, and one bathroom in our small home on 26th Street in Kansas City. I
remember that several families in our neighborhood didn't have a telephone or
radio at all.

Today in 1998, most homes have multiple televisions, two or three phones, and
often two or more bathrooms. Our current home at 2508 Wilde Avenue in Pleasanton
has four televisions, six telephones, and four bathrooms. Many people now have
car phones or carry cell phones and conduct business through email and voice
mail.

The changes aren't always improvements, though. When you call an 800 number for
a business, you typically get several recordings instead of speaking to a live
person. You're told to press different numbers depending on what information you
need, and if you're lucky, you might eventually reach a real person.

You can be sitting with someone at a restaurant when their cell phone rings,
suddenly interrupting your private conversation.

I still find it hard to believe that you can order services on a computer. It
seems like you can do almost anything on the Internet these days.

### Lessons That Lasted

Even though I've made a good living and achieved some success, my approach to
money hasn't changed since I was a child during the Depression. I still have a
difficult time with waste of any kind—whether it's throwing away food, leaving
lights on unnecessarily, or spending money on frivolous items.

I often wear clothes for years without wanting to buy anything new. When I
worked as a manager, I understood the need to dress professionally and invested
in appropriate clothing for that reason. I'm deeply conditioned to save rather
than spend, yet I realize I'm not nearly as thrifty as many of my friends who
are my age. This difference might be because I became comfortable with larger
financial transactions through buying and selling several homes over the years.

### Trading Steaks for Salads

In hopes of enjoying better health during my retirement years, I quit eating red
meat around 1985. My job required frequent travel, and I found myself eating
bacon for breakfast, roast beef sandwiches for lunch, and steak for dinner on a
regular basis. Although I am 6 feet, 2 inches tall, I weighed over 210 pounds,
which was too much for my medium frame. When I eliminated red meat from my diet,
my weight dropped to about 190 pounds, and I have maintained that weight ever
since.

My eating habits changed dramatically—I now enjoy pasta, salads, and fruit
regularly, which is quite different from how I ate growing up. I try to avoid
meat at lunch unless Mitzie and I are dining out at a restaurant. I believe my
overall health has improved significantly as a result of these changes.

### Changes in Cost of Living

The cost of living and salaries have increased dramatically over the past 40
years. To the best of my memory, here's how my income and housing costs changed
over time:

1955 (Kansas City):

- Monthly salary as brick mason: $500
- Monthly house payment: $88

1961 (Sacramento):

- Monthly salary at Burroughs Wellcome: $450
- Monthly house payment: $135

1968 (Pleasanton):

- Monthly salary after promotion: $1,000
- Monthly house payment: $350

Later years in Pleasanton:

- Cope Court house payment: $640/month
- Corte Libre (1981):
  - Monthly salary: $3,500
  - Monthly house payment: $1,500

1994 (Retirement):

- Annual salary at Burroughs Wellcome: $120,000-130,000 (depending on bonuses)
- Monthly house payment in Bend, Oregon: $2,700

Pleasanton today (1998):

- Current monthly payment at 2508 Wilde Ave, Pleasanton: $3,400
- A basic 1-2 bedroom apartment rental: $900+/month

### Sports and Athletes

The most obvious difference between athletes then and now is that ball players
are larger and stronger than the athletes were in the 1940s and 1950s. This is
primarily because of advancements in weight training and diet. Baseball has
probably changed the least, as far as the rules. The biggest change in baseball
has been the addition of the designated hitter in some leagues. Football is
different primarily because, as I stated earlier, everyone is bigger and
quicker. In football, having players play only offense or defense has made the
game better in my opinion. Basketball has changed the most, both in the athletes
(as skilled taller players are much more common), but even more important are
the rule changes which have had a great impact on the game.

The three point shot (NBA 1979, NCAA 1986) and the shot clock (NBA 1954,
NCAA 1985) have made the game faster. For most of the 1970s, the NCAA wouldn't
allow a basketball player to dunk the ball, but that rule was soon changed. You
don't see as much half court offense today since every team tries to push the
ball up court on almost every possession. The increase in dribbling skills has
also helped the game as most players today can dribble the ball behind their
back and between their legs. We were never allowed to shoot from the outside as
the strategy was to work the ball inside to your center especially if you had a
size advantage. We would have been benched if we would have dribbled between our
legs or shot anything longer than a 12 or 15 foot jump shot.

Another important consideration is that ball players in the 1940s only played
their sport during the season. Nowadays, high school basketball players play
ball year round, including several basketball camps. To keep the competitive
edge, most good high school teams play in summer leagues to get ready for the
season. My four sons, Brett, Kevin, Jeff and Mike all had superior ball handling
and shooting skills compared to me. I excelled in blocking out, rebounding, and
driving to the basket. I was also very tough on defense.

I still feel that we could have competed today because of the way we were raised
and our attitude about pain was different as bumps and bruises weren't
important. Today, young people have been raised by parents who want to give them
everything, while we were loved in a different way. Most children are a lot
softer which isn't their fault, as I believe their parents are responsible.

I strongly believe that in basketball my generation would have won most games,
even though we didn't have the same shooting or ball handling skills. Our
strength would have been in the way we set hard screens and by blocking out on
the defensive boards. We also would have tried for higher percentage shots, and
I feel that this could have been accomplished even with a shot clock. This is
only conjecture, but I wish that it was possible to go back in time so that I
could test my theory.

### Timeline of Sports Teams in Kansas City (by Brett)

Even though my dad grew up and started a family in Kansas City, the professional
sports teams the city is known for today didn't exist before he moved to
California. Growing up, the best team in town was the Kansas City Monarchs, a
dominant team in the Negro baseball league (including Jackie Robinson in 1945
when dad was 14). During his college years, they had the Athletics from Major
League Baseball. Both teams played at Municipal Stadium.

As an adult, Dad still pulled for his hometown teams (Royals, Chiefs), but he
also found joy in cheering for the teams close to his new homes (Athletics,
49ers).

- 1920: Negro Leagues - Kansas City Monarchs
- 1955: MLB - Kansas City Athletics (Philadelphia Athletics)
- 1956: Monarchs moved to Grand Rapids, Michigan
- 1961: Dad moved from K.C. to Sacramento
- 1963: NFL - Kansas City Chiefs (Dallas Texans)
