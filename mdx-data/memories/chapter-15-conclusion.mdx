## Chapter 15 - Conclusion

I have had a wonderful life and I have been fortunate to have known so many
exceptional people. I had great parents, two fantastic brothers, good teachers,
close friends, and I have worked with many talented people. I was truly blessed
to have had seven wonderful children. At this time I have seven grandchildren
and I hope and pray that I will be able to watch them grow up. I also would like
to be around when Jeff, Kevin, and Brett are married and have their own
families. Mitzie is my soul mate and she has really made my life fun and
exciting. I discussed earlier my relationship with the Lord, and I know that I
never would have had this life without knowing Jesus Christ.

I am very proud of my seven children as they have all turned out to be wonderful
citizens and fantastic human beings! Thank you Lord for Mike, Cathy, Patty,
Rebecca, Jeff, Kevin, and Brett!! You have blessed me many times, but my seven
children have been my greatest blessings.
