## Chapter 14 - Retirement Years

### Ending Well at Burroughs Wellcome

As a manager at Burroughs Wellcome, I was fortunate to work for several good
people. My last supervisor was Jerry Slater, and I learned a lot from him about
how to manage a 25 million dollar business.

For several years, my district was number one in the region, but we had a hard
time tracking dollars accurately. For the last few years of my career, we
finally had computer sales data by zip code through D.D.D. (Drug Distribution
Data). This system would give us sales for each product from each pharmacy in
each zip code.

We only bought the data by zip code rather than by individual pharmacy because
of the cost. The data that the company purchased still gave us accurate
prescription sales for each territory, district, and region in the country.

I am proud to say that before I retired, my district was number one in sales for
the pharmaceutical division for the entire country. Being number one nationally
was a great honor—it was announced at our national meeting and gave Mitzie and
me a week with the President's Club in Hawaii. I just wished that our sales
could have been tracked by zip code during my entire B.W. & Co. career.

While I was managing the Bay Area for Burroughs Wellcome, I was fortunate that I
hardly traveled during my last few years with the company. Early in my selling
career, I was on the road three out of every four weeks, though I did travel
frequently to managers' meetings and national sales meetings. When I first
started with the company, we didn't have national meetings, so I didn't see
several colleagues I had started with until we had a reunion seven years later.
The modern company was different—we had national sales meetings twice each year,
which was a great way to renew friendships.

During my time as District Manager with Burroughs Wellcome, I focused on
recruiting the best talent from all backgrounds. I was proud that this approach
resulted in my district hiring more African American, Asian American, and female
representatives than any other district nationwide—all exceptionally qualified
professionals who brought valuable skills to their positions.

After more than 30 years of traveling with the company, I'm blessed to have
visited every state except Alaska, North Dakota, South Dakota, Wisconsin,
Minnesota, and Alabama. I was fortunate to see most of the United States and
stay at many beautiful hotels. Mitzie was able to join me for the last 15 years,
and three of our trips included Puerto Rico, Hawaii, and Cancun, Mexico.

I worked with the company until September 1994, and when I retired, I was given
a fantastic party by my representatives, other managers, family, and friends. My
proudest moment was having all seven of my children at the party so everyone
could see what I had been working for all those years.

Since I retired in 1994, I have tried to learn to relax. I've found that it's
very difficult to change after many years of being a manager; under constant
pressure to make my sales quotas. I have always been described as intense and
competitive. I think that's why I always enjoyed going to manager's meetings
where I would be around people that were intense and competitive just like me.

I don't miss all of the 12 hour days as I used to work in my office three to
four hours each night after arriving home from working with a sales
representative all day.

I do miss the people that I worked with. Many of the managers at BW & Co. were
also my very good friends.

### Move to Oregon

After retiring from Burroughs Wellcome in September, 1994, Mitzie and I decided
to sell our home in Pleasanton. We wanted to move to either Arizona, Colorado,
or Oregon as we had always wanted to try living somewhere else. We planned to
visit each area before making up our minds.

Mitzie had corresponded with several cities in each of the above states, and the
Chamber of Commerce made each town look very attractive. Mitzie and I both
agreed that we wouldn't make a decision until we had seen each state.

Our financial advisor, Steve Schliesser, had clients in Bend, Oregon, so we
decided to visit there first.

On the way to Bend, we also stopped in Medford, Ashland and Grants Pass, Oregon,
to see what these towns had to offer.

Once in Bend, we went out with our realtor and, after seeing several properties,
she took us to Broken Top Club, a country club in the heart of Bend. We both
fell in love with the area and decided, then and there, that we should buy one
of the lots for sale.

The promise that Mitzie and I made to each other about not buying a home until
we had seen all of the areas didn't hold up after seeing all of the beautiful
scenery in Oregon.

We would need to get several bids from local contractors to build our own home.

We hired Don McPrang, a local architect, who designed a beautiful home for us.
We then awarded the construction bid to Steve Berg of Sound Construction. Both
of these choices were excellent as Steve built a fantastic home for us on the
4th fairway at Broken Top. This was the home of our dreams and we had everything
that we had ever wanted.

Reflecting back on our move up north, we had been warned by many people that the
residents in Oregon wouldn't like people moving in, especially from California.
We found that the opposite was true. However, Broken Top Club was probably not
the best way to test this claim due to more than one half of the residents being
retired Californians. Even so, the people that we knew who were raised in Oregon
became some of our best friends.

Californians are still moving to Oregon, but are also paying their share of
taxes which are improving the schools, roads, etc. The Oregon natives like the
new shopping centers and the many businesses that are moving into Bend. It's
true that home prices did go up, although a young couple can still buy a house
for under $100,000.

There may have been ill feelings toward Californians in Portland and along the
coast, but we didn't have this experience in Bend, Oregon. Living in Bend was a
great experience for our whole family and I believe we all benefited from the
move.

I was eager to move to another state to escape California's overpopulation and
traffic.

Mitzie had just finished her written and oral boards to become a fully licensed
and independent practitioner in therapy and counseling. After all of the
preparation and studying leading up to that, she was ready for a break.

Jeff had a good job at the Athletic Club of Bend while he attended Central
Oregon Community College. He also played golf several days a week.

Kevin found out that he could compete in school and sports at Mountain View High
School, a large public school with over 2200 students. He finished his freshman
school year with a grade point average of over 3.75 and made a lot of new
friends.

Brett attended Cascade Middle School, where there were over 900 total students.
Brett was a straight "A" student and was honored by being selected as Scholar
Athlete of the Year for the entire student body.

I was pleased that the boys could acclimate to their new schools and had no
trouble finding friends. This move seemed to give each of our sons confidence in
knowing that they could adapt to a new location and experience away from
Pleasanton.

Our home in Bend was about a twenty minute drive to Mount Bachelor, one of the
largest ski resorts in the United States. The area was so beautiful that we
thought we would stay in Oregon for the rest of our lives.

### Back to California

Meanwhile, Jeff decided to move back to Pleasanton. We found out that it wasn't
easy to drive back and forth between Bend and Pleasanton (especially when the
highways started getting icy). We were really missing our other children and
grandchildren. We missed every birthday for the grandchildren, even after
agreeing that we would try to come back for each one.

The weather was another thing working against us. Mitzie enjoyed the snow on the
beautiful trees surrounding the property, but it only reminded me of my
childhood in the midwest, where it snowed and was freezing all winter. I didn't
like shoveling the snow from the driveway each morning, especially with our
house being about 80 feet from the street.

Mitzie was also beginning to feel that she shouldn't be so far away from her
parents who, at the time, were in their mid seventies.

Before moving to Oregon, Mitzie and I had both agreed that if either of us ever
desired to move back to California within the first year, we would respect each
other's wishes.

We contacted a realtor to list our home.

Our family had a great year in Oregon, but for all of the reasons listed above,
we moved back to Pleasanton in July of 1996. We now jokingly refer to our move
to Oregon as a one year vacation.

We didn't find out until after we sold our house that, on average, it took two
and a half years to sell a home in our price range. We had already committed to
buying a house back in Pleasanton, thinking that our home was going to sell
quickly like the houses in California. We sold our home in about six months, so
we know that the Lord was with us!

Mitzie and I both enjoyed making the fresh start by moving to a new area, though
along with a new start comes a certain amount of risk. When we moved to Oregon,
she canceled her practice in California which upset quite a few of her clients.
Thankfully, when we moved back to California, and the word was out about her
return, she had a full schedule within several weeks.

We have been truly blessed financially with our home purchases and sales—we've
made money on several homes and broken even on our most recent transaction. Our
houses have always been in high demand, probably because Mitzie does an
outstanding job of decorating. Since our marriage in 1977, we have sold four
houses and purchased five.

Since we've moved back from Oregon, I've been able to spend some time with three
former friends of mine from Burroughs Wellcome: Jerry Slater, who was my former
supervisor, Jack Nesselroad, and Charlie Perrigo who I worked with in the Bay
Area for many years.

We meet for lunch once a month and have coffee or tea just about every week. I
think that we all have been somewhat surprised that the company has been able to
make it without us.

### Still Coaching

I am currently an assistant coach for the Boy's Varsity Basketball and Varsity
Baseball teams at Valley Christian High School in Dublin, CA.

While I'd love to coach forever, I've recently had knee replacement surgery on
both of my legs, so I don't know what is in the future. Although I don't have
pain in my knees now, I'm still restricted in the activities that I can
participate in. For example, I can't play tennis or basketball, but I can play
golf as much as I want. Unfortunately, I enjoy golf less than most sports,
probably because I don't play that well.
