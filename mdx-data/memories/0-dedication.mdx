I would like to dedicate "My Memories" to my mother and father. I was blessed to
have had these two, wonderful people for parents. My mom was very loving and I
am sure that she is the person most responsible for my good self worth. My dad
was a hard working man who, along with my mother, gave me my values. My brothers
and I were fortunate to have had a good start in life.

When future grandchildren read "My Memories", I hope that they feel the same way
about their parents. It is my prayer that this love for their parents continues
to be passed down from generation to generation.

Hopefully, through these memories, my grandchildren and great grandchildren will
know something about their grandfather Gadd. I would have loved to have had a
book like this about my grandparents.

To my children and grandchildren: I love you very much and I will be watching
from heaven when the Lord takes me home. Remember that Jesus loves you!

Love,

Dad and Grandpa - 1998
